HW 2 - Problem 5a: Stooge Sort:
    This program sorts an input of integers by reading lines of integers from "data.txt" and writes the 
    sorted arrays to "stooge.out". 

Input and Preconditions:
    "data.txt" must be comprised of integers delimiated by any amount of whitespace. 
    The first integer on each line is the number of integers to be sorted and is not part of the sorted output

    For example, the input:
    4 19 2 5 11  
    8 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 

    Would have an output of:
    19 11 5 2
    6 5 4 3 2 2 1 1

    Additionally, "data.txt" must exist in the same directory as this README. The programs will not run if "data.txt" does not exist. 

To Run:
    First, ensure that "data.txt" exists in the same directory as this README file!

    To run the stooge sort program:
    Run: ```python3 stoogesort.py```
    This will create an output file "insert.out"
