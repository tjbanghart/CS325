HW 3 - Problem 4: Shopping Spree:
    This program is a modified version of the knapsack dynamic programming problem. The setup is as follows:

    Acme Super Store is having a contest to give away shopping sprees to lucky families. 
    If a family wins a shopping spree each person in the family can take any items in the store 
    that he or she can carry out, however each person can only take one of each type of item. 

    Essentially, this is an algorithm to determine the maximum total price of items for each family 
    and the items that each family member should select.

To Run:
    First, ensure that "shopping.txt" exists in the same directory as this README file!

    To run the shopping spree program:
    Run: ```python3 shopping.py```
    This will create an output file "shopping.out"

Input and Preconditions:
    "shopping.txt" must be comprised of integers with the following charecteristics:
    - T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) is given on the first line of the input file.
    - Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer number N that indicates the
        number of items (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) in that test case
    - Followed by N lines, each containing two integers: P and W. The first integer (1 ≤ P ≤
        5000) corresponds to the price of object and the second integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 100)
        corresponds to the weight of object.
    - The next line contains one integer (1 ≤ F ≤ 30) which is the number of people in that
        family.
    - The next F lines contains the maximum weight (1 ≤ M ≤ 200) that can be carried by the
        ith person in the family (1 ≤ i ≤ F).
